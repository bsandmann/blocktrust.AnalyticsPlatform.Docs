Preprod is one of multiple test-networks of the *Cardano* Blockchain and considered the final testing stage for release. This is true for core developments for the blockchain itself, as for PRISM-related products and services. Multiple projects run their own PRISM nodes, to facilitate the read/write operations of PRISM operations to the blockchain.

Note that according to the [specification](https://github.com/input-output-hk/prism-did-method-spec/blob/main/w3c-spec/PRISM-method.md), the full DID-PRISM identifier for preprod DIDs looks identical to the ones on *mainnet*. To avoid confusion, a discriminator (did:prism:*preprod*:123...) is added here. DIDs without any discriminator are always considered to be on *mainnet* only.
