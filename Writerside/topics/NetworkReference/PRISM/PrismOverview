The DID-PRISM method is anchored on the Cardano Blockchain, an open, permissionless third-generation blockchain.
Anyone is free to create, update, deactivate, and publish DIDs according to the specifications of the DID-PRISM v2 method. Operations based on the obsolete v1 method are no longer supported or tracked here.
The main client is the Hyperledger Identus cloud agent, initially developed by IOG and now open-source and maintained by the community together with IOG.
Development work is ongoing, primarily on the PreProd Network. Production use cases on the Mainnet for PRISM v2 are still rare.
