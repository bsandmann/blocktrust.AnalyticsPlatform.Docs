The *DID-PRISM* method is anchored on the *Cardano* Blockchain, an open, permissionless third-generation blockchain.
Anyone is free to create, update, deactivate, and publish DIDs according to the [specification](https://github.com/input-output-hk/prism-did-method-spec/blob/main/w3c-spec/PRISM-method.md) of the *DID-PRISM v2* method. Operations based on the obsolete *v1* method are no longer supported or tracked within the *Blocktrust Analytics* tooling.
The main client is the [Hyperledger Identus](https://github.com/hyperledger/identus) [cloud agent](https://github.com/hyperledger/identus-cloud-agent), initially developed by [IOG](https://iohk.io/) under the brand of [Atala](https://www.atalaprism.io/) and now open-source and maintained by the community together with IOG.
Development work is ongoing, primarily on the *Preprod* Network. Production use cases on the *Mainnet* have been existed for *v1* and now also showing up for *v2*.
