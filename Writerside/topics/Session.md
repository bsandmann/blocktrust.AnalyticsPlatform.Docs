# Session Management
A session is a versatile tool for analyzing specific datasets stored within pools. It is designed to accommodate analysis of data across either a single pool or multiple pools simultaneously. Additionally, it is possible to initiate multiple sessions that all reference the same pool, enhancing flexibility in data analysis.

Attaching a Session to Pools
To link a session to one or more pools, simply select the desired pools by checking the corresponding boxes. Among the pool options, you will find the "Public pool," which exclusively contains publicly available Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) that are published on blockchains. It is recommended to always include the "Public pool" when selecting pools, in addition to any custom pools you may have created.

Pool Data Integration
Located below the pool selection area is a checkbox labeled "Add the complete pool to the graph." Activating this option incorporates all data from the chosen custom pools into the graph view. This feature is particularly useful when dealing with pools that comprise a limited number of Verifiable Presentations (VPs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), allowing for a comprehensive view of the data.

For pools with a larger volume of data, which may become overwhelming visually, it is advisable to leave this option unchecked. Beginning with an empty graph view enables a more manageable approach to data analysis. Specific VCs, VPs, or DIDs can be incrementally added to the graph using the search function, facilitating a targeted and efficient analysis without the clutter of excessive data.
